# Link About

Link About is an uncomplete Mozilla Firefox Addon, that enable all 
occurrences of about: URLs in any Webpage as clickable Hyperlinks.

## Caveats

Due to security limitations of Firefox these links do not work as
normal links. They will not be loaded automatically from inside any
unsecure web page context.

But you will be able to open these in a new tab and manualy load there.
